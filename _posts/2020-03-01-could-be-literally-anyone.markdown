# Welcome!

Hi folks. I'm a person on the internet.

I'm not trying to be intentionally sneaky (only a little bit). If you look really closely, you can probably figure out who I am, and that's really okay. 

## What's this all about?

This is really more of an experiment than anything else. I've been around on the internet for a while. A long while. I realized a few things recently:

1. I haven't really created a new online presence in a really long time. I've been kind of building off a persona I created nearly 20 years ago (I get it, I'm old. Thanks kids.) 

2. The internet feels less like a playground now than it did when I first started with it. Back then, things felt pretty wild west and crazy, and it didn't really matter what I did because everyone was doing nutso things. 

3. I kind of want to have the _feeling_ of starting over without, well, actually starting over. 

## Uh-huh. And?

So here's what I did. 
* I made a new email address: couldbeliterallyanyone_at_gmail_dot_com. 
* I made a new GitHub account (surprise! I like to write code. I'm not a software engineer, but I've been a casual coder for more than 2 decades.)
* I created a new Twitter account. If you really want to, you can follow me [@literalanyone](https://www.twitter.com/literalanyone).
* And... that's it.

## So what?

Here's the plan:

I'm going to write some stuff. I'm going to build some stuff. I'm going to engage with people and see what happens. My goal isn't anonymity, it's just a little bit of freedom to play around. I'm not trying to be a jerk. There is no plan to say anything hateful or hurtful or engage with hateful or hurtful people. 

I'm doing a couple of things for myself: 

* I've never fully participated in #100DaysOfCode. So I'm doing that. Setting up this blog (Jekyll + GH Pages) is the first step. It was harder than I expected. I learned a few things.
* I want to be slightly more engaged with politics (not too much). I have some unique perspectives about the situation in the United States (political parties are mostly trash, but I find myself left of center on most things.) I'll tweet some things, talk about some things and maybe lol at some folks from time to time. 
* I need to lose some weight. So I may talk about that too. We'll see. 

Anyway. That's it for now. 

Signed,

Literally Anyone
