Ya'll. Twitter is hard. Follow me [@LiteralAnyone](https://twitter.com/LiteralAnyone).

## Not my first rodeo

As mentioned previously, I have a different Twitter account. I have a lot different accounts. Won't be sharing them here. When I got on Twitter the first time, I did things the usual Twitter way. At least, what I imagine is the usual way. Basically, it went like this.

* Create account
* Follow the 25 or 30 people I know already on Twitter
* Follow a few celebrities or news outlets
* Write some tweets
* RT a few things
* Rinse and repeat for while
* Get followed by like a million pornbots. Block _all_ of them.
* Eventually end up with like 35 or so legitimate followers and 300-400 brand companies hoping you'll follow them back because you followed them
* Get a few likes here and there
* Get bored
* Basically switch Twitter to view only mode
* Read Twitter occasionally
* Sometimes write amusing anecdotes

This time around, I'm hoping to do things a little differently. So far, this has not accomplished much, but we'll see. Maybe as I continue, things will change. The basic plan looks like this:

* Follow more people
  * Topics I'm engaging with right now:
    * Politics
    * Coronavirus
    * Gaming
    * Startups/Investing
* Engage more with folks _inside_ of threads. 
  * For what it's worth, this is where I've seen the best engagement. Since I have amassed a total of _18_ followers, no one is really seeing what I write otherwise.
* Write more content to tweet about
  * This is an example of that. Sort of self-serving, and the self-referential nature of it makes me feel like I'm just part-timing as an SEO/Digital Marketing expert. 
  * Want to take a moment and call out just _how many_ SEO/Digital Marketing hacks there are out there on Twitter. Twitter keeps recommending more of them to follow, and despite the fact that I'm doing my best to avoid them, they're still showing up in my Timeline and in my recommendations.

## So Far

I've tweeted just over 120 times in 6 days. Hard to know if that's high or low, but I think it's probably pretty close to the level I'll be able to sustain. Most of my tweets are never seen. The range of impressions of tweets where I'm not hitting a hashtag or responding to someone else is 20-50, which is about what I expect from people just hitting the overall Twitter timeline. 

When people do see my tweets there are some interesting engagement numbers.

This tweet for example:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wonder what the demographics of the survey population are. The average person outside of tech hubs probably isn&#39;t aware of how much influence AWS has or even connects AWS to Amazon in any meaningful way. To them, Amazon is how they get stuff fast and cheap.</p>&mdash; Literally Anyone (@LiteralAnyone) <a href="https://twitter.com/LiteralAnyone/status/1234478823481073665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 2, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

That hit about 900 impressions, with 11 engagements (likes, retweets or responses), which seems pretty good for a new account with, again, _18_ followers.

In total, my tweets have been seen (but maybe not read) 23.3k times in the last week. Obviously, I'm just starting out, so I don't know for sure whether anything I'm doing is working or not.

I guess we'll see.
