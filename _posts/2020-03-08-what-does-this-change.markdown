# Where We Stand

As of this writing, there are [over 500](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/live-blog/coronavirus-updates-live-1st-case-confirmed-washington-d-c-u-n1152416/ncrd1152641) confirmed cases of [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covid-19) in the United States. More than 100,000 cases have been reported globally - a number that is suspected to be underreported for a variety of reasons.

Last week, we saw unprecedented activity as multiple Fortune 500 companies announced that they would be limiting interviews to remote video conferencing and moving a lot of their workforce to optional or mandatory remote work for undetermined amount of time. The country of Italy has imposed a quarantine on roughly a quarter of its population. There has been a run on hand sanitizer, bottled water, and most surprisingly... toilet paper. 

Amidst all of this chaos, major financial firms projected, at the _beginning_ of March, that profit growth across the board would be slashed to zero. The financial markets tanked, and even significant, drastic moves by the US Federal Reserve and other central banks to cut interest rates, investors were still spooked and drove one of the fastest market corrections in history.

Uncertainty, miscommunication and poor leadership are driving news cycles across the board as governments, political party leaders and news pundits around the world accuse each other of mishandling, misreporting or miscommunicating the important issues. Twitter is on _fire_ about who said what, and when, and ultimately we just have a situation where a lot of people know very little about what's going on and even less about what kind of an impact an event like this could or will have on the global economy and their own lives.

# What's Next?

Over the next weeks and months, we can expect a few things to happen. Companies will evaluate their working situations. While major corporations are unlikely to make any significant adjustments vis-a-vis remote work, I think there will be a rash of mid-size companies and startups moving to mostly (or all) remote work. There will be companies that make pretty big changes to their contigency plans, their org charts and, in general, their mode of operations in order to avoid or mitigate the types of risks that come along with this type of event. 

Here's how I see it:

* We've already seen the impact to travel and tourism. Obviously this will impact those industries, but there are geographic impacts as well. Many countries and cities drive their main source of revenue from tourism. Expect a downturn for those areas in the near future. Revenues will be cut significantly, smaller players will be forced out.
* Remote work will become more popular. Plenty of people will be working from home the next couple of months and absolutely hate it, because they don't have established routines or habits to cope with the isolation, but I think a pretty huge chunk of folks are going to realize that they are more productive - and happier - away from the office. If being in the office isn't a requirement for your job, you suddenly have a lot more options when it comes to where you live. 
* Recession is likely - across the board. No one really wants to talk about this, but you can't shut down so much manufacturing, travel and operations without seeing ripple effects across the global economy. The economy (at least the corporate economy) has been on a _tear_ for the least decade. We're overdue for a correction (which we've seen) and more overdue for a significant pull back. Consumer spending and confidence will decline, and that's certainly something to be concerned about in the near term.
* Expect pops in remote technologies (think Zoom) in the near term, but friction as those services rub up against their natural limitations. This is the biggest opportunity for the future, I think. Competitors to the existing infrastructure will pop up, but even more important, there will be _completely new_ ways of working that become popular. Think hybrid-remote, flexible schedules, changing compensation structures. There will be new challenges coming very soon, and _huge_ openings for new startups or enterprising incumbents to take advantage.

What are you planning to do differently in the next months as we cope with and rebound from the coronavirus?
