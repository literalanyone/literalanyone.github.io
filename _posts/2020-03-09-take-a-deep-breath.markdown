# Whoa

Woke up this morning to see S&P futures halted in trading as the NYSE braced for a >5% loss at the opening bell. The market crossed the 7% 'circuit breaker' threshold basically instantly, and the markets were halted for 15 minutes. Briefly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow 30) was down more than _2000 points_, the largest intraday market loss in _history_. Investors are panicking over coronavirus, oil prices, and the real possibility of an oncoming recession after more than a decade of steady (even accelerated) capital growth. So, yeah, people are scared. But, as Douglas Adams would say: "Don't Panic."

## History is on our side

Interestingly, the lesson of the stock market has to be relearned over and over again with new generations of investors. There are cycles, up and down, typically driven by trigger events, and these happen _all the time_. In only the last quarter century we had the Dot-Com bubble burst in the 1999-2000, the housing market crash in 2007 and subsequent Great Recession in 2008-2009, and now we have this. Whether triggered by COVID-19 or by oil prices or just by the fact that stocks are probably overpriced relative to their underlying fundamentals, the reality is that we have seen this before, and come out of it. Even with all of these massive downswings, the expected AAR (average annual return) of the stocks traded on the NYSE hovers just over 10% a year.

However, the variance (swings) in the market are much higher than that. In any given year the market could be up as much as 50% (unlikely in the current era, due to wider accessibility to the markets) or down as much as 50% (see 2008). What that means in layman's terms is that, in order to _benefit_ from the 10% AAR of the stock market, you need to be in it for a long time. If you are, then your returns will be generally positive. For context, the market _low_ in the Spring of 2009, after the largest recession in recent history, was still 3x the value of the market 20 years earlier (same week 1989). 

Stocks win, in the long run. 

## What do I do now?

It depends:

* Is your money already in the market? If so, wait out the storm. Pulling your money out now only has the effect of locking in (realizing) losses for your investments. The time to sell was weeks ago, and you missed it. That's okay, but don't make things worse by limiting your future upside.
* Is your money in cash? This might be a good time to consider buying back in. Obviously, consult with your financial advisor (that's not me), about what makes the most sense for you. In general, the right approach is to not do things all at once. If you buy in, buy a little at a time over days, weeks or months. But remember that when you're buying into the equit market, your investments should be in things you plan to hold for the next 15-20 years or longer. If that's not the case for you, consider other types of investments with lower variance (but yes, lower total returns as well).
* Are you relatively young? If you're in early in your career, you'll have more time between now and retirement for your equities to grow, making buying decisions overall less risky. If your time horizon is shorter (<20 years), again, consider lower risk investments with more stable returns. 

## Closing Thoughts

The stock market is scary. A lot of folks have their retirement savings wrapped up in a significant amount of stock. When those numbers start swinging wildly, it's really easy to get spooked and make what will likely be a bad decision. Hold on tight, the ride is going to be bumpy, but we'll all be all right.
